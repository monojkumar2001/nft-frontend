                This Cookie Policy describes how NFT CONSTRUCTER (the "Company,"
                "we," "us," and "our") recognizes you when you visit our website
                at https://nftconstructer.com using cookies and other similar
                technologies ("Website"). It describes these technologies, why
                we use them, and your rights to limit how we use them. In some
                circumstances, we might use cookies to gather personal data, or
                that data might turn into personal data if we combine it with
                other data.

              <p className="urbanist-black-16">
                When you visit a website, a cookie—a little data file—is
                downloaded to your computer or mobile device. In order to make
                their websites function, or function more effectively, as well
                as to give reporting information, website owners frequently use
                cookies. First-party cookies are those that a website's operator
                (in this case, NFT CONSTRUCTER) sets. Third-party cookies are
                those that are placed by organizations other than the website's
                owner. Cookies from third parties enable the provision of
                third-party features or functionality on or through the website
                (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). When
                you visit the website in issue as well as a few other websites,
                the parties who place these third-party cookies may be able to
                identify your computer.

              <h3 className="pp-sm-title">1.1 Why do we use Cookies? </h3>
              <p className="urbanist-black-16">
                We use cookies to gather information about how users engage with
                our content and to enhance their experience on our site.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h3 className="pp-sm-title">1.2 Site Functionality </h3>
              <p className="urbanist-black-16">
                Visitors can share our website's content and suggest it on
                Facebook and Twitter by using the share feature. Even though
                they do not include personal information, cookies record how
                users use the sharing function so that the site can be enhanced.
                No data is saved if you refuse to allow cookies. When you visit
                a page containing videos embedded from or linked to YouTube, for
                example, we use third-party suppliers for some of the features
                on our site. You may want to check the policies of these
                third-party websites for information regarding their use of
                cookies since these videos or links (and any other content from
                third-party suppliers) may contain third-party cookies.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h3 className="pp-sm-title">1.3 Cookies we Use </h3>
              <p className="urbanist-black-16">
                 Google Analytics, which is used on this website, uses cookies.
                To enhance the website and guarantee a positive user experience,
                cookies collect data on how users use the site in aggregate
                form, such as the number of pages displayed, the visitor's
                origin, and the frequency of visits. No data is saved if you
                refuse to allow cookies.

              <p className="urbanist-black-16">
                We won't utilize cookies to gather a visitor's personally
                identifiable information. <br /> By altering your browser
                settings, you can opt to accept or prevent the cookies that NFT
                CONSTRUCTER sets; for more information, use your browser's
                "Help" function. Please be aware that most browsers accept
                cookies by default, so you might need to manually delete or
                block cookies if you don't want them to be used. <br /> Please
                check the user manual for your mobile phone for information on
                how cookies are used in mobile phone browsers and how to refuse
                or delete such cookies.

              <h3 className="pp-sm-title">1.5 Essential website cookies: </h3>
              <p className="urbanist-black-16">
                These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with
                services available through our Website and to use some of its
                features, such as access to secure areas.

                2. How can I control cookies on my browser:
              </h2>
              <p className="urbanist-black-16">
                You should check the help menu of your browser for more
                information as the methods by which you can reject cookies
                through your web browser options differ from browser to browser.
                The following details how to control cookies on the most widely
                used browsers:
                <br />- Chrome <br /> ■ Internet Explorer <br /> Firefox <br />
                ■ Safari Edge <br /> ■ Opera You can also choose not to receive
                targeted advertising from the majority of advertising networks.
                Please go to the following website if you'd like further
                details: <br /> Digital Advertising Alliance <br /> Digital
                Advertising Alliance of Canada <br /> European Interactive

              <h2 className="pp-title">
                3. What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?
              </h2>
              <p className="urbanist-black-16">
                Cookies are not the only method for identifying or tracking
                website visitors. Occasionally, we might also utilize other,
                related technologies, such web beacons (sometimes called
                "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). They are small graphical
                files with a special code that let us know when someone visits
                our website or opens an email containing them. This enables us
                to do things like track user movement from one page of a website
                to another, send cookies to your computer or device, determine
                whether you arrived there via a third-party website, enhance the
                functionality of the website, and assess the efficacy of email
                marketing campaigns. Some technologies frequently rely on
                cookies to operate effectively, therefore disabling cookies will
                make them less functional.
              </p>

              <h2 className="pp-title">
                4. Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?
              </h2>
              <p className="urbanist-black-16">
                Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as
                Local Shared Objects or "LSOS") to, among other things, collect
                and store information about your use of our services, fraud
                prevention, and for other site operations.
                <br />
                Local Shared Objects, or "LSOS," are another term for the
                so-called "Flash Cookies" that certain websites utilize for a
                variety of purposes, including data collection and storage
                regarding how users interact with their services, fraud
                prevention, and other site operations.
                <br />
                The tools in the Website Storage Options Panel allow you to
                modify the settings of your Flash player to prevent the storing
                of Flash Cookies if you do not want them to be done so on your
                computer. Please be aware that configuring the Flash Player to
                restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may limit or
                hinder the performance of some Flash apps, potentially affecting
                the way they interact with our services or online content.
              </p>

              <h2 className="pp-title">5. Do you serve targeted advertising?</h2>
              <p className="urbanist-black-16">
                For the purpose of serving advertisements on our Website, third
                parties may place cookies on your computer or mobile device. To
                deliver relevant adverts for products and services you might be
                interested in, these businesses may utilize information about
                your visits to this and other websites. They might also use
                tools for evaluating how successful adverts are. Companies can
                do this by gathering data from your visits to this and other
                websites using cookies or web beacons, which will allow them to
                show you relevant adverts for products and services that may be
                of interest to you. Unless you choose to offer your name,
                contact information, or other data that directly identify you,
                the information obtained through this method does not allow us
                or them to identify you.
              </p>

              <h2 className="pp-title">
                6. How often will you update this Cookie Policy?
              </h2>
              <p className="urbanist-black-16">
                In order to reflect changes to the cookies we use or for other
                operational, legal, or regulatory reasons, we may occasionally
                amend this Cookie Policy. In order to stay up to date on how we
                use cookies and other related technologies, we ask that you
                frequently check this Cookie Policy. The last time this Cookie
                Policy was changed is indicated by the date at the top.
